            <p>Ronaldo has played for several top football clubs, including Sporting Lisbon, Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus before moving to the Saudi professional league in Saudi Arabia where he currently plays. Lionel Messi too has played for top clubs but not as many as CR7 e.g., Barcelona, Paris Saint Germain, and now Inter Miami FC. Both have won multiple league titles and UEFA Champions League trophies during their time with these clubs, the difference being only in the number of times they have won them and with which club.</p>

            <h2>International Career</h2>
            <p>Despite both being the captains of their national teams, Messi is the only one of the two to have lifted the World Cup trophy as he won the tournament at the end of the year 2022, before previously winning the Copa America. Ronaldo is a key player for the Portugal national team despite him not featuring as much as him and others would have wished in the 2022 Qatar FIFA World Cup.
